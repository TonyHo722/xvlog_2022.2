# xvlog_2022.2

1. run simulation by run_xsim
2. I found the simulation result is different in vivado 2022.1 and 2022.2
- compare the xsim.2022.1-pass.dump and xsim.2022.2-fail.dump

I try to update the xvlog_tb.v and I found it relative to the coding sytle in the code, reference this [commit](https://github.com/TonyHo722/xvlog_2022.2/commit/936c984ab0769e1a5a2170f1a259b7effe24f7df)
